# TicketTracking-repo
Ticket Tracking prototype app in C
With this app you can either enter a control panel which gives u ability to see all the reserved tickets and delete them, also you can add new Travelling lines from inside the code.
Other option is to use the app as a client, which will ask you for some personal information, and give you the ability to choose which cities you want to travel.
At last all the tickets reserved will be added to the database and everything will be updated.
